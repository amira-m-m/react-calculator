# React Calculator

## Introduction

This project serves as a practical application of the skills acquired through beginner and advanced React courses provided by Meta. It is a sequential calculator application built with React.js, Chakra UI, and the [bignumber.js](https://mikemcl.github.io/bignumber.js/) API.
